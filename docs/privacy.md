1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how LetGo collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the app. By using LetGo, you consent to the practices described below.

2. Information We Collect

LetGo is designed with user privacy in mind. The app does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly stated. However, we may collect the following types of data:

a. Local Data (Stored on Your Device)
Emotional tracking input (e.g., mood logs, goals, affirmations)
Usage history (e.g., completed sessions)
Subscription status (to unlock premium features)
This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.

b. Anonymous Usage Analytics (Optional)
If enabled, we may collect anonymous analytics to understand app usage and improve user experience. No personal data is attached to this tracking.

3. In-App Purchases

All transactions are handled securely via the Apple App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Please refer to Apple’s privacy policy for more details on in-app purchases.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties. Your emotional logs and session data remain private and local to your device.

5. Third-Party Services

If we use trusted third-party services (such as RevenueCat for subscription management), they are bound by their own privacy policies and App Store compliance.

6. Data Retention

All local data is stored on your device for as long as the app remains installed. Uninstalling the app will delete locally stored data.

7. Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store personal data on external servers, no request is needed to delete your information. If you wish to clear app data, you may do so manually via your device settings or by uninstalling the app.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
